	Purge guts and use Text::Karma instead

	Use pocoirc-plugin-BotCommand to handle the 'karma' command, so
	it behaves like other plugins using BotCommand. Also made the reply
	method configurable, and make it use NOTICE by default, which is the
	commonly accepted default for all bot-generated output.
